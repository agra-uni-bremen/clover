# clover

A library for concolic execution of RV32 instruction set simulators.

## Motivation

This library serves as an abstraction over [KLEE][klee website]
specifically designed to ease concolic execution of RV32 instruction set
simulators. Currently, KLEE is only used as a fancy SMT Solver. Since
the majority of KLEE features is not required by this library, a bundled
version of KLEE is included which only depends on Z3 and LLVM. This
approach was also taken by [SÂ²E][s2e klee] and eases using KLEE as a
library.

## Usage

This library has the following dependencies:

* A C++ compiler toolchain with C++17 support
* A recent version of [Z3][z3 repo] (`4.8.X` is known to work)
* A recent version of [LLVM][llvm website] (`10.0.1` is known to work)

If all dependencies have been installed this library can be added to an
existing RV32 instruction set simulator (e.g. as a git submodule).
Afterwards, it can easily be integrated into CMake-based build systems
through the [`add_subdirectory`][cmake add_subdirectory] directive.

## Development

A pre-commit git hook for checking if files are properly formatted is
provided in `.githooks`. It can be activated using:

	$ git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
